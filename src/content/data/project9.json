    "abstract": "The Project (DIY Arduino Based Robotic Arm) is building and programming a robotic arm using an Arduino microcontroller. The robotic arm is capable of performing various tasks such as picking and placing objects and manipulating objects in different orientations. Components and materials, such as servos motors, and an Arduino board, construct a functional robotic arm. The essential concepts like servo motor, kinematics, and inverse kinematics, enabling to understand the principles behind the arm's movements and implementation in project. Different programming techniques to control the arm, including manual control using potentiometers and automated control through pre-programmed sequences are used. The project also serves as a foundation for further exploration and customization, enabling users to enhance and expand the capabilities of the robotic arm according to their specific needs and interests.",
    "introduction": "A robot is a machine designed to execute one or more tasks automatically with speed and precision. We need robots because robots are often cheaper to use over humans, in addition it is easier to do some jobs using robots and sometimes the only possible way to accomplish some tasks[1]. By developing a DIY robotic arm using Arduino, we aim to provide an affordable solution that can be easily assembled and programmed by individuals interested in robotics. Robotic arms are widely used in industries and research fields for their ability to perform precise and repetitive tasks.",

      "Arduino has six ADC channels. We have used four for our Robotic Arm. The UNO ADC is of 10-bit resolution so the integer values ranging from 0-1023 (2^10=1024 values). This means that it will map input voltages between 0 and 5 volts into integer values between 0 and 1023. So, for every (5/1024= 4.9mV) per unit.",
      "Arduino ADC channels have a default reference value of 5V. This means we can give a maximum input voltage of 5V for ADC conversion at any input channel. Since some sensors provide voltages from 0-2.5V, so with a 5V reference, we get lesser accuracy, so we have an instruction that enables us to change this reference value."
